# Guideline-to-set-timeout-option-on-rails
To achieve these PostgreSQL timeout settings in a Ruby on Rails application, you need to configure the appropriate database connection settings in the Rails application and potentially use database-specific configurations to manage query, transaction, and statement timeouts. Here's how you can do it:

### 1. **Set `statement_timeout` in Rails**

The `statement_timeout` is a PostgreSQL setting that terminates queries that run longer than a specified time. In Rails, you can configure this at the database level through the `database.yml` file.

To set the `statement_timeout` for PostgreSQL:

- Open the `config/database.yml` file in your Rails application.
- Modify the `production` (or whichever environment you want) section to add the `statement_timeout` option under `database` settings.

For example:

```yaml
production:
  adapter: postgresql
  database: your_database_name
  username: your_database_username
  password: your_database_password
  host: your_database_host
  port: 5432
  statement_timeout: 5000 # Timeout in milliseconds (5 seconds)
```

This will apply the `statement_timeout` setting to all queries in the production environment. You can adjust the value based on your needs.

### 2. **Set `transaction_timeout` in Rails**

PostgreSQL’s `transaction_timeout` setting determines the maximum time allowed for a transaction to run. While Rails doesn't have an explicit setting for `transaction_timeout`, you can control this through your PostgreSQL connection settings.

You can use a **PostgreSQL hook** or execute custom SQL before beginning any transaction in your Rails application.

You can execute `SET transaction_timeout` for each transaction in Rails by using a `before_action` filter in an initializer.

For example, in `config/initializers/database_timeout.rb`:

```ruby
ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute("SET statement_timeout = 5000") # 5 seconds
ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute("SET idle_in_transaction_session_timeout = 10000") # 10 seconds
ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute("SET transaction_timeout = 20000") # 20 seconds
```

This will set the transaction timeout for all active database connections during the Rails application runtime.

### 3. **Setting `replica` Configuration for Foreign Key Checks**

If you want to disable foreign key checks, typically this would be managed at the database level. This is often done when working with replication setups.

In Rails, if you're dealing with replica databases and want to disable foreign key checks, you can manage that within your database configuration. You could disable foreign key checks on the replica server, but that might require database-specific PostgreSQL triggers or replication strategies.

For example, you could configure the replica in your `database.yml` as:

```yaml
replica:
  adapter: postgresql
  database: your_replica_database_name
  username: your_replica_username
  password: your_replica_password
  host: your_replica_host
  port: 5432
  foreign_key_checks: off # Disable foreign key checks for replicas
```

This is a conceptual example. PostgreSQL typically disables foreign key checks via triggers when necessary, which is more about setting the right replication model. This setup would be generally managed at the PostgreSQL level, rather than being directly managed in Rails configuration.

### 4. **Handling Query Timeouts in ActiveRecord**

In addition to database-level timeouts, you can manually control timeouts for individual queries in your Rails application using ActiveRecord’s `find_by_sql` method or raw SQL execution.

For example:

```ruby
begin
  User.find_by_sql('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1')
rescue ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid => e
  # Handle the timeout exception or other SQL errors
  Rails.logger.error "Query timed out: #{e.message}"
end
```

### 5. **Conclusion**

To implement PostgreSQL timeouts in your Rails app:

- Set `statement_timeout` in `config/database.yml` for query timeouts.
- Use custom SQL execution in an initializer for `transaction_timeout` and other database-related timeouts.
- Adjust foreign key checks for replicas at the PostgreSQL level, using replication settings or triggers.

Each timeout (e.g., `statement_timeout`, `transaction_timeout`, etc.) should be handled at the database connection level or within your transaction control logic in Rails.
